#Bizsitegenie Web Application Framework#
An Open Source Full Stack Framework in Javascript prebuilt with the most common features that every web application needs. 

##MEAN Framework for Rapid Application Development##
Bizsitegenie can come in handy for Rapid Application Development. You can get a lot done before you even write your first line of code. 

It is built on top of the MEAN Framework at meanjs.org. It gives us the complete code base for our stack with the Authentication module already in place. That gives us User Login and Registration along with Social Logins. 

It also has a builder UI to generate CRUD code with complex relationships with ease. You can assign permissions to each modules based on user groups and roles. UI can also be used to create dashboards and graphs. Spreadsheets can be uploaded to import existing data and automatically create appropriate CRUD based on the spreadsheet columns.

See it in action in this 3 minute video:

##Three components sharing the same database instance##
The MongoDB database instance will be shared between the Builder Interface, Builder and the Website. User inputs through the Builder Interface will be stored in the builder tables. The generator will pick information from these tables to generate the client files. Once client files are generated, user can use the website. At any given time, user with the creator rights can go the builder interface to update the website and regenerate the application code.

##Builder controls the main website files##
Builder should be able to generate the files in the main website folder
